## PSP Media Engine Cracking The Unknown

This project is an attempt to shed light on the Virtual Mobile Engine (VME) present in Sony's PSP, as well as the H.264 decoder, both available on the Media Engine side, by digging into the surrounding components and elements such as the local DMACs and VLD unit, the known specialized instructions like those reusing the LDL and SDL opcodes, and what appears to be a bitstream sent to the VME.
